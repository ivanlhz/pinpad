# React PinPad - AcidTango

## Introduction

This project is about a short programming exercise where I need to create a Pinpad with the instruction provided by email.

## Steps

In this programming exercise I followed the following steps

### 1) Layout design

Use figma in order to create base layout
https://www.figma.com/file/nEK87apwWqgQcY4k3LvStm/Pin-Code?node-id=0%3A1

Test the base layout of pinpand in codepen

### 2) Remove the base CRA project components

### 3) Tests

### 4) Create components

### 5) Components tests checks an revision

### 6) Create the css styles

### 7) Test the final application and make last fixes

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
